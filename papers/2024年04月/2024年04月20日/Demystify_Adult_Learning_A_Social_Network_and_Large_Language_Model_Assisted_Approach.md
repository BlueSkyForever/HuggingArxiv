# 摘要

> 成人学习正日益被视为推动个人成长和社会前进的关键途径。尽管如此，它也充满挑战，特别是成人学习者在兼顾教育与生活其他责任时面临的独特困难。通过收集成人学习者的反馈，可以有效洞察他们的顾虑并优化学习体验，而社交网络则提供了一个获取成人学习者实时情感数据的宝贵渠道。尽管机器学习技术，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs），在自动化情感分析方面表现出色，但目前尚未有专门针对成人学习进行精准情感理解的模型。本文介绍了A-Learn，这是一个通过结合成人学习特定领域的数据集来提升成人学习情感分析的工具，它利用现有的通用LLMs进行了定制。我们搜集了社交网络上成人学习者的评论，并利用现有的LLM对每条评论的情感进行了标注，创建了适合成人学习的标记数据集。这些数据集随后用于定制A-Learn，以多个基础LLMs为基础。我们的实验研究表明，A-Learn在情感分析上表现出色，准确度可达91.3%，相较于基础LLM提升了20%。此外，A-Learn还被应用于词云分析，帮助识别成人学习者的核心关切。本研究的成果强调了将机器学习技术与教育专业知

> Adult learning is increasingly recognized as a crucial way for personal development and societal progress. It however is challenging, and adult learners face unique challenges such as balancing education with other life responsibilities. Collecting feedback from adult learners is effective in understanding their concerns and improving learning experiences, and social networks provide a rich source of real-time sentiment data from adult learners. Machine learning technologies especially large language models (LLMs) perform well in automating sentiment analysis. However, none of such models is specialized for adult learning with accurate sentiment understanding. In this paper, we present A-Learn, which enhances adult learning sentiment analysis by customizing existing general-purpose LLMs with domain-specific datasets for adult learning. We collect adult learners' comments from social networks and label the sentiment of each comment with an existing LLM to form labelled datasets tailored for adult learning. The datasets are used to customize A-Learn from several base LLMs. We conducted experimental studies and the results reveal A-Learn's competitive sentiment analysis performance, achieving up to 91.3% accuracy with 20% improvement over the base LLM. A-Learn is also employed for word cloud analysis to identify key concerns of adult learners. The research outcome of this study highlights the importance of applying machine learning with educational expertise for teaching improvement and educational innovations that benefit adult learning and adult learners.
