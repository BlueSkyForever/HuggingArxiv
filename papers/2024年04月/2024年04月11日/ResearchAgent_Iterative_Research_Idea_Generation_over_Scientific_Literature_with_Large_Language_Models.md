> ResearchAgent: Iterative Research Idea Generation over Scientific Literature with Large Language Models

# 摘要

> 科学研究对提升人类生活至关重要，却常因复杂性、进展缓慢和专业门槛而受阻。为提升科研效率，我们设计了一款名为“研究代理”的智能写作助手，该助手由先进的大型语言模型驱动，能够自动产生问题、方法和实验设计，并通过科学文献的不断迭代优化。操作伊始，选定一篇核心论文作为灵感源泉，我们的“研究代理”不仅通过学术网络连接相关文献，还结合了基于概念的实体知识库中的实体信息，这些实体在众多论文中被挖掘并共享。此外，借鉴人类通过同行评审逐步优化想法的做法，我们引入了多个“评审代理”，它们提供连续的评审和反馈。这些代理配备了与人类评价标准一致的大型语言模型，其评审标准基于真实人类判断。通过在多个学科领域的科学出版物上的实验验证，我们的“研究代理”在生成创新、清晰且有效的研究构想方面展现了显著成效。

> Scientific Research, vital for improving human life, is hindered by its inherent complexity, slow pace, and the need for specialized experts. To enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers. In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are derived from actual human judgments. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showcasing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid research ideas based on human and model-based evaluation results.
