> Multimodal Emotion Recognition by Fusing Video Semantic in MOOC Learning Scenarios

# 摘要

> 在MOOC学习环境中，教学视频的深层含义对学习者情绪的影响不容忽视。本研究独辟蹊径，提出了一种结合视频语义和生理信号的多模态情绪识别新方法。通过预训练的大型语言模型提炼视频内容，捕捉视频的深层语义，再结合眼动和PPG信号，通过交叉注意力机制进行信息融合，提取关键特征。借助情绪分类器，精确识别学习者的情绪变化。实验证明，这种方法显著提升了情绪识别的准确度，为MOOC学习中的情绪分析开辟了新的研究路径。这一成果不仅深化了我们对教学视频如何影响学习者情绪的认识，也为未来相关领域的研究提供了宝贵的借鉴。

> In the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) learning scenario, the semantic information of instructional videos has a crucial impact on learners' emotional state. Learners mainly acquire knowledge by watching instructional videos, and the semantic information in the videos directly affects learners' emotional states. However, few studies have paid attention to the potential influence of the semantic information of instructional videos on learners' emotional states. To deeply explore the impact of video semantic information on learners' emotions, this paper innovatively proposes a multimodal emotion recognition method by fusing video semantic information and physiological signals. We generate video descriptions through a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to obtain high-level semantic information about instructional videos. Using the cross-attention mechanism for modal interaction, the semantic information is fused with the eye movement and PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) signals to obtain the features containing the critical information of the three modes. The accurate recognition of learners' emotional states is realized through the emotion classifier. The experimental results show that our method has significantly improved emotion recognition performance, providing a new perspective and efficient method for emotion recognition research in MOOC learning scenarios. The method proposed in this paper not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the impact of instructional videos on learners' emotional states but also provides a beneficial reference for future research on emotion recognition in MOOC learning scenarios.
