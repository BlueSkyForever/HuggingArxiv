# 摘要

> 人工智能（AI）广泛应用于解决市场营销归因与预算优化问题。尽管AI模型复杂性较高，缺乏专业团队支持，理解模型运作和洞察变得颇具挑战。理论上，新型的大型语言模型（LLMs），例如GPT-4，能够提供市场洞察，从而简化关键决策的制定过程，节省时间和精力。然而，要有效运用这些模型，还需克服不少实际难题。本文重点探讨了特定领域的问答系统、SQL生成以及表格分析，并阐述了如何通过结合语义搜索、提示设计和微调技术，显著提升LLMs在执行这些任务时的准确性。我们对包括GPT-4在内的专有模型和如Llama-2-70b的开源模型，以及不同的嵌入技术进行了比较，并在市场营销组合建模和归因的具体用例中对这些模型进行了测试。

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely deployed to solve problems related to marketing attribution and budget optimization. However, AI models can be quite complex, and it can be difficult to understand model workings and insights without extensive implementation teams. In principle, recently developed large language models (LLMs), like GPT-4, can be deployed to provide marketing insights, reducing the time and effort required to make critical decisions. In practice, there are substantial challenges that need to be overcome to reliably use such models. We focus on domain-specific question-answering, SQL generation needed for data retrieval, and tabular analysis and show how a combination of semantic search, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning can be applied to dramatically improve the ability of LLMs to execute these tasks accurately. We compare both proprietary models, like GPT-4, and open-source models, like Llama-2-70b, as well as various embedding methods. These models are tested on sample use cases specific to marketing mix modeling and attribution.
