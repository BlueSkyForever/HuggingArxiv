> "Like a Nesting Doll": Analyzing Recursion Analogies Generated by CS Students using Large Language Models

> 面对复杂的计算概念，学生们往往觉得将其与已知经验和理解相联系是个难题。为此，恰当的类比如同一座桥梁，能有效连接陌生与熟悉，生动地促进理解。但即便是资深教师，创造高质量的教学类比亦非易事。本研究探讨了大型语言模型（特别是ChatGPT）能否即时生成与个人紧密相关的类比。我们聚焦于“递归”这一颇具挑战性的核心概念，对350多名一年级计算机科学新生生成的类比进行了深入探究。学生们在拿到一段代码后，借助ChatGPT创建自己的递归类比，并鼓励结合个人生活实际话题。研究发现，学生们自主选择话题所生成的类比表现出丰富多样的特性，与常规类比相比更显独特，彰显了在运用LLMs学习过程中，激发学生创造性的重要价值。参与活动的学生们反响热烈，不仅享受其中，且表示对递归的理解得以深化，尤其提到那些与个人经历和文化背景息息相关的类比更加易于记忆。

> Grasping complex computing concepts often poses a challenge for students who struggle to anchor these new ideas to familiar experiences and understandings. To help with this, a good analogy can bridge the gap between unfamiliar concepts and familiar ones, providing an engaging way to aid understanding. However, creating effective educational analogies is difficult even for experienced instructors. We investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, can provide access to personally relevant analogies on demand. Focusing on recursion, a challenging threshold concept, we conducted an investigation analyzing the analogies generated by more than 350 first-year computing students. They were provided with a code snippet and tasked to generate their own recursion-based analogies using ChatGPT, optionally including personally relevant topics in their prompts. We observed a great deal of diversity in the analogies produced with student-prescribed topics, in contrast to the otherwise generic analogies, highlighting the value of student creativity when working with LLMs. Not only did students enjoy the activity and report an improved understanding of recursion, but they described more easily remembering analogies that were personally and culturally relevant.
